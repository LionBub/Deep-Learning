Added deep_learning.ipynb which has a different, more sophisticated network in each cell. These are copied from Grokking. Used these to learn about different regularization methods.
Added MNIST_refactored.ipynb which is my own refactored and cleaned up copy of the final MNIST Grokking example. Each part of the network is clearly separated. Used to understand the inner workings of convolutional neural networks before i start using TensorFlow or pytorch.
